# DecoherenceLab

Progress will be tracked here.
For now, development will be conducted in a private git repo in order to facilitate the use of git's server hosting service.

## Local Deployment

Run ```npm run dev:website``` from the project root directory after cloning the repository onto your machine.
This will run a local version of the website on localhost:3000. 

Our site is also deployed at render.com. 

### Testing

Our tests achieve 94% coverage: this can be verified by checking the ``code coverage" workflow.
